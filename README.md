# **Intern Management System**

This is an intern management system that I worked as part of my university project for the Monash University Malaysia. The project
consists of three modules: Employer, Student and the Coordinator (or University Administration). I specifically worked on the 
Employer module, particularly focusing on the frontend side of things.
